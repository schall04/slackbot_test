At this point, I can help you lookup what test suites can be run, and actually running them. \n\nFor example, to find out what suites are available, you can ask \"@Payments Automation Bot what suites are available?\"\nFor another example, to run a suite, you can type \"@Payments Automation Bot run <suitename>\"\n\nYou can enter \"@Payments Automation Bot help\" anytime you need some help.\n\nYou can also open a direct message with me if you want to keep our interaction private.\n\nEnjoy!",
